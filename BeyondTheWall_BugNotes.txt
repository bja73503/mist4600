BUGS TO FIX:

= As of 7/24 =================================================================================================
> Set currentRoom = d1 if player enters cave in g4
> Set currentRoom = g2 when new Game is started
> Prompt for when player encounters a walker
> Long descriptions for significant rooms
> fix descriptions so they make sense to the user
> when winGame() or loseGame() run, the game needs to end
> Only have the "Items: " prompt come up if there are items to get
> need a take method for player to take items and add them to inventory

UPDATE [07.24-02]:
IDEA: change HashMap item attribute in Room class to be just an item. That way, a room can only have one item -- because we don't have any rooms > 1 item anyway -- and thus we eleminate the need to specify the name of the Item. This would make the take(Command command) method much easier to execute. 
> Would require reworking the declaired items in Game class.

> make sure there are prompts to explain to a player when s/he has added item to inventory
> command for listing inventory?

Sneak mechanic: 
> method for sneaking action (roll 1d20 + modifiers from items)
> method for the sneaking conditions:
   -> if sumSneak < 7, player loses game and game ends
   -> if sumSneak >= 7, player successfully sneaks and may continue moving 
> method for walker presence; boolean attribute of Room
   -> true => walker is present
   -> false => walker is absent
> in goRoom(), make the room the lpayer moves to run hasWalker(). If hasWalker == true, run the sneak conditional. If player does not sneak, player loses; if player types "sneak", run sneak command. 
   -> If sneak command is successful, allow player to continue. Lest, end game with loseGame()
